The following text was in the 0201419726_CD.sit file I downloaded from the publisher's website, as the CD-ROM was not included in my physical copy of the book (7th printing, February, 2003).  I decompressed the contents, and have added the Linux specific source here, which I believe is within the distribution rights granted by the source code.  Should anyone wish to access the book, an on-line copy is available at the Open Library, which can be checked out here:  

https://openlibrary.org/books/OL683184M/A_programmer%27s_guide_to_sound

CD-ROM contents in StuffIt version 5 format may be found here:

I could not find any Linux source to extract the contents, so I grabbed an older version of the StuffIt Expander for Windows (version 5.5) and ran it under Wine to extract the contents.
